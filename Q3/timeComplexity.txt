Assumption 1: The vector is sorted

If the vector is sorted then first we have to get the size of the vector.

     vector.size() ----- > O(1)

Check if the number is odd or even -----> O(1)

Return the middle element if odd or the average of the middle two elements if even -------> O(1)

The time complexity of this is O(1).

*********** If the vector was not sorted, the the sorting takes O(nlogn) and that will be the answe**********
