Proof by contradiction for FindMax Function.


1. Let us assume the result given to us by the function is: i 

2. let us assume that the vector has another element which is greater than i: j
 		
		Therefore, j > i
		
3. Let the input be inputs = { ..... i, .... , j, ....}

4. When we reach the iteration where n = inputs[j], our result = i;

5. if(n > result) result = n; 
	i.e. if(j > i) result = j
	But the result did not change and result = i
	
	That means j < i or j = i. This is a contradiction!! So the algorithm is correct!!
